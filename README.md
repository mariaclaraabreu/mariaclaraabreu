## Hey there! 👋 
I’m Maria Clara, a front-end developer with over 10 years of experience.

💻 I specialize in turning ideas into beautiful, functional interfaces using React, TypeScript, and modern JavaScript.

🏡 My journey into front-end development started over 10 years ago, self-taught at home — and I’ve been hooked ever since!

🎓 I hold a degree in Software Engineering from the Federal University of Ceará (UFC), which helped strengthen my technical foundation and broaden my perspective as a developer.

👩‍💼 I’ve worked on a variety of projects, always focused on clean code, accessibility, and crafting great user experiences.

🚀 I’m driven by challenges, continuous learning, and that sweet feeling when everything runs smoothly on the front-end.

🎯 If there’s code to write and good vibes in the air (maybe some forró playing in the background), I’m all in!
